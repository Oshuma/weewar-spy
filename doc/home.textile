I probably need to create some kind of Road Map.

* Version 1.0:  All basic data reporting and simple derived calculations
* Version 2.0:  Persistence; Game History, Code clean-up
* Version 3.0:  Additional derived calculations; Location-based information/reporting
* Version 4.0:  Support different UIs
* Version 5.0:  Become Advisor

After v1.0 it's all 'Pie in the Sky'.  Right now I'm focusing on getting 1.0 code-complete.  I need to provide additional break-downs/reporting of a players units; terrains is done.
